# 🏦 Banking Data Analysis

This repository contains a **data analysis project on a banking dataset**, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, and visualization.  
The aim is to uncover insights about customer behavior and prepare the data for potential predictive modeling.

---

## 🚀 Motivation
Banking datasets often contain rich information about customers, transactions, and campaigns.  
Analyzing such data helps in:
- Understanding **customer demographics & behavior**
- Identifying **patterns and correlations**
- Providing a foundation for **predictive models** (e.g., predicting term deposit subscription)

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **banking-related attributes** (numerical & categorical).  
- Columns include:
  - Customer details (age, job, marital status, etc.)
  - Financial details (balance, loan, housing, etc.)
  - Campaign-related data (previous contact, outcome, duration, etc.)  

*(If dataset is public, you can link the source here. If not, mention "Dataset is confidential / internal.")*

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** – basic plotting  
- **Seaborn** – statistical visualization  

---

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
### 1. Data Cleaning & Inspection
- Checked **missing values**  
- Verified **data types** for consistency  
- Identified categorical vs numerical variables  

### 2. Summary Statistics
- Descriptive stats for numerical features (mean, median, std, min, max)  
- Frequency counts for categorical features  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Histograms and bar plots for distribution analysis  
- Box plots for outlier detection  
- Count plots for categorical variables  

### 4. Correlation Analysis
- Generated **correlation matrix** for numerical features  
- Visualized correlations with a **heatmap**  

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Missing values were detected and handled appropriately  
- Numerical features displayed varying distributions, with some containing outliers  
- Categorical variables showed trends in customer demographics and behavior  
- Correlation analysis revealed relationships among financial indicators (e.g., balance vs duration)
