# 🏦 Banking Data Analysis

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a banking dataset. The goal is to understand the data, detect patterns, and visualize insights using Python libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Inspect dataset structure  
- Identify **missing values** and handle them  
- Explore **data types**  
- Generate **summary statistics**  
- Create visualizations to understand feature distributions  
- Build a **correlation matrix** for numerical features  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data handling and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** – plotting and charting  
- **Seaborn** – advanced visualizations

## 📊 Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Inspection**
   - Checked missing values
   - Verified column data types  

2. **Summary Statistics**
   - Descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables  

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms, bar plots, and box plots for distribution analysis  
   - Count plots for categorical features  

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Correlation matrix for numerical features  
   - Heatmap for visual understanding
